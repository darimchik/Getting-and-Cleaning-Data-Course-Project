 Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project submission includes:


 1) A code book called CodeBook.md that describes the data, and the files provided for the course project, followed by the analysis part, which provides step-by-step comments on
 transformations that were performed to clean up the data and conduct the analysis documented in run_analysis.R.


 2) R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

 
 3) A tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
